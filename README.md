# google-homepage 
My first GitHub project ever.

HTML/CSS Project-Google Homepage

This took me 10h approximately.
It's not pixel perfect. Time is precious... ;)
Finally got an understanding of how blocks work, etc. Valuable knowledge!

It's incredible how complex google's homepage structure is. Moreso the styling.
Gained an appreciatiation for this time-consuming front-end design/implementation work!

This is just the beggining :-)
